Contains work toward a javascript app that inserts a webwork problem into an html page.

The idea is to allow more flexibility in inserting iframe/webwork sections into an html page and to provide
some protection for passwords which will be kept in localStorage and not in the html file.

This is also supposed to eventually interface with Learnosity clients.
